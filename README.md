# Simple Crud FlaskApp

This project is one test of Flask framework, which is a Python framework.

How the title already said, is a CRUD app ( Create, Read, Update and Delete methods ), but without update method.

I used the next python dependencies:

Flask;

Flask-Talisman ( it manage the security config headers );

Bcrypt;

Cryptography;

Peewee ( ORM - Object-Relational Mapping, to database );
